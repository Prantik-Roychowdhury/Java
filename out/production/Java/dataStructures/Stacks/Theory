Stacks:
1) With Array:
    Adding a data into a stack is called push, the operation is called push operation
    Deleting a data from the top of the stack is called pop, the operation is known as pop operation
    To view an element from the stack, we use the peek operation.

    Use top variable to start adding the data into the stack, initially the top is initialized by -1
    To stop adding elements beyond the length of the array, you get an error, called stack overflow, use the following condition to prevent overflow
    Condition:
        if(top==size-1)
