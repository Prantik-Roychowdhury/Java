Characteristics of Collection Framework
We can store collection of heterogeneous type of data.
Size is not fixed.
For all CRUD operations, it has some in-built methods.
Data is stored in the form of objects i.e., auto-boxing will take place.

Collection Interface:
Collection is an interface present in java.util package.
Iterable interface provides a way to iterate through the elements of a collection by using methods like:
iterator()
hasNext()
next()

Miscellaneous Methods
size() – returns the length.
isEmpty() – checks whether collection is empty & returns boolean result.
hashCode()
equals()

Collection framework is present in util package, ArrayList is the implementing class of list interface
ArrayList:
ArrayLists internally makes use of dynamic array
ArrayLists can store null values
ArrayList is an index based datastructures
ArrayList can store heterogeneous data
ArrayList can store duplicates
ArrayLists can be sorted
The initial capacity is 10
The ArrayList is full, a new array will be created internally whose size is going to be 50% more than the previous array.
It is calculate by, new capacity = Old Capacity + (Old capacity/2)
Insertion and Deletion takes O(n)
ArrayList is not thread safe, also known as Asynchronous
Insertion order is maintained

In collections, linked list is implemented by Doubly-LinkedList
Preferred in case of deletion, insertion
LinkedList is also synchronized
Linked list is a node based datastructures
Linear data structure
No initial capacity or incremental capacity of linked list
Add duplicates, null values and heterogeneous value

Vectors:
The internal datastructre is dynamic array
It is a legacy class
Vector can hold duplicates, null and heterogenous values
The insertion order is maintained
When a vector is completely filled a new vector with twice the size will be created and the elements will be copied into the new list from the new list

Sets:
    Tree set:
    Internal datastructures of tree set is a tree map
    All the elements which are being added in the tree set must implement comparable interface
    Tree set does not allow duplicates, null values.
    If null values are added the program does not throw an error instead it throws a NullPointer exception during execution
    Tree set internally makes use of compareTo() method of comparator interface to remove duplicates
    Insertion order in tree set is not maintained
    All the elements inserted will be sorted in ascending order as its natural sorting order
    Tree set is not indexed based, it is node based, makes use of red-black tree
    Tree set does not support heterogeneous values as well
    If heterogeneous values are added ht program does not throw any error, instead it throws a class cast exception
    Tree set is preferred for adding and removing of elements as it takes O(logn) time, also it is preferred to use when a set needs to be sorted

    ClassCast Exception occurs due to the compareTo implementation, as the object types are different, it throws a class clast exception
    internally Integer class has compareTo method implemented, which is then used to arrange the data in ascending order thanks to auto-comparision
