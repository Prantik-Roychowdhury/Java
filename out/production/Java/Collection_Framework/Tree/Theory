Method:
put(key, value): key and value together is called an entry
clear():    removes the entire collection
replace(Key, value): Replaces the value at the given key
keySet(): Used to fetch only the keys of the entire map
values(): Fetches only the values of the map
entrySet(): method provides a way to access these key-value pairs as a set of Map.Entry objects

The keys in a treemap must be of homogeneous type, it will throw a class cast exception otherwise
The natural sorting order of treemaps is decided by keys (ascending order)
All the keys that are being added into the treemap must implement the comparable interface, and the keys must be of same type of comparable data.
In treemap the keys cannot be duplicated, if a duplicate is added the old entry will be changed with the new entry
Keys can never be null, values can be null, we can have multiple null values with different keys
