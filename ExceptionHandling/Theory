It is an object which is created due to faulty input or faulty logic which will lead to a runtime error and abrupt termination of the program if it is not handled
There are two types of exceptions:
1)Compile-Time and 2)Run-time
RTS will check for exception handler in the class, if it is not present, it will pass it to JVM which has a Default exception class that terminates the program abruptly
Hierarchy:(These are all classes)
Object:
    Throwable:
        I)Exception:            II)Error:
    i)Unchecked Exception:      Virtual Memory
    Runtime:(Unchecked)         i)StackOverflowError
    a)Arithmetic                ii)OutOfMemory
    b)Nullpointer               iii)Linker
    c)ClassCastException
    d)NegativeArraySize
    e)IndexOutOfBounds:
      i)StringOutOfBounds, ii)ArrayOutOfBounds
    ii)Checked Exception:
    a)SQL, b)IO: FileNotFound

Arithmetic Exception: Division by zero
ClassCast Exception: When two non-primitive datatypes are being casted into the same datatype and if they do not have a Is-A relationship it will throw an exception
NullPointer Exception: When a non-static member is being accessed by null reference
IndexOutOfBounds Exception: When you try to access the index of a list which crosses the bounds of the list
ArrayIndexOtOfBounds: Same thing bu in case of arrays
StringIndexOutOfBounds: Same
NegativeArraySizeException: When you provide the size of an array as a negative integer
FileNotFoundException: When you try to access a file which does not exist in the absolute path provided by you.
*Any problems that occur during at runtime is an exception not an error*

Example of StackOverFlowError:
    Recursion without a base condition

ExceptionalInitializerError is a child class of Error
Exception Propagation:It is a mechanism in Java where an exception is passed from the method in which it occurred to the calling methods in the call stack until it is caught and handled
Throws(Keyword): The throws keyword is used in a method declaration to specify that the method might throw certain exceptions, informing the caller that they must handle these exceptions either with try-catch blocks or by declaring them further up the call stack

Unchecked Exception" Compiler unaware exceptions are known as unchecked exceptions, compiler aware exceptions are known as checked exceptions
Irrespective of the type of exception (checked or unchecked) an exception object is always created during runtime or during executions.
Whenever compiler encounters a checked exception, the compiler will throw an error and force the programmer to either handle the exception or throw the exception
Handling an exception:
It is handled by using try and catch block
Catch block will not be executed if an exception object was not created
