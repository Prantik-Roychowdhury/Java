 Java Operators Associativity Table (Excluding Bitwise Operators) ðŸ’¡

âœ… Table:
Category	Operators	Associativity	Precedence
Postfix	expr++, expr--	Left to Right	Highest
Unary	++expr, --expr, +, -, !, ~	Right to Left	Higher
Arithmetic	*, /, %	Left to Right	High
Addition/Subtraction	+, -	Left to Right	Medium
Shift	<<, >>, >>>	Left to Right	Medium
Relational	<, <=, >, >=	Left to Right	Lower
Equality	==, !=	Left to Right	Lower
Logical AND	&&	Left to Right	Low
Logical OR	`		`
Ternary	? :	Right to Left	Lower
Assignment	=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, ^=, `	=, <<=, >>=, >>>=`	Right to Left
ðŸ”¥ Key Points:
Associativity determines whether the expression is evaluated left-to-right or right-to-left when operators have the same precedence.
Precedence defines the order in which operators are executed.
Right-to-left associativity mostly applies to unary, ternary, and assignment operators.
