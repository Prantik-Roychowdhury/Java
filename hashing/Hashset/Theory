Why is HashSet an important datastructure?
-> Because HashSets are extremely time efficient, i.e they have low time complexity
Operations with Time Complexity
Insert/Add      --> O(1)
Search/Contains --> O(1)
Delete/Remove   --> O(1)

In comparison with Sorted Array
O(1)    |   O(n)
O(1)    |   O(log n)
O(1)    |   O(n)

HashSets do not contain repeated value, i.e every value in the HashSet is unique
